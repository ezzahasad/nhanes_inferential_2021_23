This project analyzes data from the NHANES 2021–2023 cycle to explore relationships between demographic factors and health-related outcomes. The dataset was cleaned, recorded, and analyzed in Python, and the same statistical procedures were replicated in R to verify that the results were consistent across programming environments. The research questions focused on marital status, education level, sedentary behavior, weight, and systolic blood pressure.

Data preparation included removing placeholder values (such as 7777 and 9999) and recording key variables to simplify interpretation. Marital status was grouped into “married” versus “not married,” and education level was grouped into “bachelor’s degree or higher” versus “less than bachelor’s.” Weight and sedentary behavior values were cleaned by converting the variables to numeric and removing missing or invalid records.

The statistical analysis addressed five main research questions. A chi-square test was used to examine whether marital status was associated with educational attainment, since both variables were categorical. An independent sample t-test was used to compare average sedentary time between married and not married individuals, because this test evaluates differences in means between two groups. A multiple linear regression model was used to evaluate how both age and marital status jointly predict systolic blood pressure, allowing us to assess the contribution of each predictor while controlling for the other. A Pearson correlation test was used to determine whether there was a linear relationship between weight and sedentary behavior, since both variables were continuous. Finally, an additional chi-square test was used for a student-generated question evaluating whether marital status was associated with self-reported kidney health.

Results from Python and R were consistent across all analyses. For example, the correlation between weight and sedentary behavior was statistically significant but weak (approximately r ≈ 0.15), indicating that weight is not a strong predictor of sedentary time. Age was shown to be a strong predictor of systolic blood pressure, while marital status had a smaller but statistically significant effect. Other relationships, such as marital status and education level or marital status and kidney health, showed no significant association.

### Reflection
Navigating through Google Colab was relatively easy as it directly ran and allowed us to view the results without going to different tabs or sections. However, I did notice that I needed to manually upload my NHANES files every time the environment had reset. This was different when working in VS Code locally, since everything remained saved in the system without needing to reupload the files. Learning R and replicating our Python analysis also helped confirm the accuracy of the results and improved my comprehension on how the same statistical tests function similarly in different programming environments. There were some troubleshooting errors encountered relating to variable names and placeholder values, but quickly fixed from additional data cleaning and debugging skills. Overall, this assignment strengthened my ability to perform statistical analyses and interpret results in both Python and R.
